        <h4>Basic React App</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic react app is installed using <b>npx create-react-app <i>"app-name"</i></b></li>
                <li>It install test packages and web vital package by default, which leads to take more time to install</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Vite react app is installed using <b>npm create vite@latest</b> and then providing required inputs</li>
                <li>It installs only react and react-dom needed to begin with, and let user decide what else to install and thus faster to install</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ultimately everything turns to html, css and js only. index.html in public directory is what finally runs.</li>
                <li>React related code is kept in src where index.js or index.jsx is called first and it used App.js or other files</li>
                <li>It is conventional to use jsx as extension if we return html from js file.</li>
                <li>React only return one component so, all tags need to be covered with &lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt; tags.</li>
            </ul>
